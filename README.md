- 👀 Pretty much anything to do with Linux self-hosting or VM provisioning of, predominately Linux, but occassionally Windows servers.
- 🌱 My current projects revolve around email, email marketing and spam control (mautic, mailtrain2, listmonk, postfixadmin, modoboa, iredmail, roundcube, opendkim, opendmarc, greylisting, clamav, amavisd-new, spamassassin, automx, fail2ban, imapsync) and general business/admin systems (invoiceninja, parse-dmarc, bind9, lamp, lemp, baïkal).
